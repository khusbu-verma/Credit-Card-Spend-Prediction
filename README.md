# Credit-Card-Spend-Prediction
The goal of this exercise is to analyze a dataset consisting of information from credit card holders and to comprehend which factors influence the Credit Card Balance of a cardholder and to predict the average Balance of a given individual. Such an exercise could be conducted as part of a customer analysis within a credit card company. The results of the analysis could determine which customers present a risk of credit default, or what the expected consumer behavior of prospective customers will be. In addition, combining the credit Balance data with information such as credit Limit can assist in calculating the credit utilization of a card, information which feeds into a cardholder's credit Rating.  For this goal, a multivariable regression analysis will be undertaken. The exercise will begin with an exploratory data analysis of the dataset, followed by feature selection and regression analysis, including linear and logistic regression. Lastly, the regression model created will be employed to simulate a new dataset and predict the credit Balance of cardholders given their demographic information.
